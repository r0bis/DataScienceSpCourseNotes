# Data Science Specialization Course Notes

I have compiled notes for all 9 courses of the Johns Hopkins Unversity/Coursera Data Science Specialization. The notes are all written in **R Markdown** format and cover all concepts convered in class, as well as additional examples I have compiled from lecture, my own exploration, _StackOverflow_, and _Khan Academy_. These documents are intended to be comprehensive sources of reference for future use and they have served me wonderfully in completing the assignments for each course. So I hope you will find them helpful as well. 

They are by no means perfect, so feel free to correct, contribute (send a pull request), or use them in anyway you would like. 

You will find **HTML**, **PDF**, and **R Markdown** files here in this repository in each of the corresponding folders. You can view the HTML versions [here](http://sux13.github.io/DataScienceSpCourseNotes/)

# Data Science Methodology

  1. Problem Formulation – First, **identify the problem to be solved**. This step is _easily overlooked_. However, many dollars and hours have been spent solving the wrong problems.
  2. Obtain The **Data** – Next, collect new data and/or gather the data that already exists. In _almost all cases, this data will need to be transformed and cleansed_. It is important to note that this stage does not always involve big data or a data lake.
  3. **Analysis** – This is the part of the process where insight is to be extracted from the data. Commonly, this step will involve creating and optimizing statistical/machine learning models for prediction, but that is not always necessary. _Sometimes, the analysis only contains graphs, charts, and basic descriptions of the data_.
  4. **Data Product** – The end goal of data science is a data product. The insight from the Analysis phase needs to be conveyed to an end user. The data product might be as simple as a _slideshow_; more commonly it is a website _dashboard_, a _message_, an _alert_, or a _recommendation_.
